		h3 Aero
	p
		| Aero is a website framework based on Node, Express, Jade and Stylus.
		| The main design goal is performance, a &nbsp;
		a(href='https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=blitzprog.org', target='_blank') PageSpeed rank of 100/100
		| &nbsp; is easily possible. It inlines a lot of needed resources into the initial response which reduces HTTP requests,
		| thus making it perfect for high latency environments. Aero was born from the need to quickly load pages from any place in the world.
		| Additionally it makes sure that the website is only loaded once, the links are converted to AJAX calls.
		| Pages support permalinks, therefore you can do SEO without any problems.
	p
		| This website runs on Aero.

		h3 Flua
	p
		| A 4th generation programming language that abstracts existing programming languages
		| and solves common parallelization problems.
		| Sadly, this project is currently "frozen".
		| One day I'd love to continue working on it, probably a complete rewrite with another common data format and in another programming language.
